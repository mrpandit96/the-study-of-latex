\normalsize 1.1 What is LATEX?
LATEX (pronounced lay-tek ) is a document preparation system for producing
professional-looking documents, it is not a word processor. It is particularly
suited to producing long, structured documents, and is very good at typesetting
equations. It is available as free software for most operating systems.
LATEX is based on TEX, a typesetting system designed by Donald Knuth in
1978 for high quality digital typesetting. TEX is a low-level language that
computers can work with, but most people would nd dicult to use; so
LATEX has been developed to make it easier. The current version of LATEX is
LATEX2e.
If you are used to producing documents with Microsoft Word, you will nd
that LATEX is a very dierent style of working. Microsoft Word is `What You
See Is What You Get' (WYSIWYG), this means that you see how the nal
document will look as you are typing. When working in this way you will
probably make changes to the document's appearance (such as line spacing,
headings, page breaks) as you type. With LATEX you do not see how the nal
document will look while you are typing it | this allows you to concentrate
on the content rather than appearance.
A LATEX document is a plain text le with a .tex le extension. It can be typed
in a simple text editor such as Notepad, but most people nd it is easier to
use a dedicated LATEX editor. As you type you mark the document structure
(title, chapters, subheadings, lists etc.) with tags. When the document
is nished you compile it | this means converting it into another format.
Several dierent output formats are available, but probably the most useful
